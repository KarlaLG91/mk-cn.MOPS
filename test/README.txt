All the samples underwent targeted NGS sequencing using a targeted SureSelect XT custom array (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Wokingham, UK; 0.5–2.9 Mb capture).

Realigned and recalibrated BAM files were obtained with the ‘Indel realigner’ and ‘Table Recalibration’ function from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK–version 2.4–9).

## test-reference/039970_D_BED_20120404_pad50.bed

Costum BED file fir SureSelect XT array, where the first column is a chromosome (e.g. "1"), the second and third columns are start and end position of a region, respectively. BED files must end with the suffix ".bed".
